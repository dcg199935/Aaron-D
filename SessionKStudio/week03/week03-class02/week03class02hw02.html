      Translated from the French by David Bellos
    </h4>

    <h4 id="letter">
      To Denis Buffard Incalculable are the benefits civilization has brought<br />

      originated by the inventions and discoveries of science. Inconceivable
      the<br />
      marvellous creations of the human sex in order to make men more happy,<br />
      more free, and more perfect. Without parallel the crystalline and
      fecund<br />
      fountainsof the new life which still remains closed to the thirsty lips
      of<br />
      the people who follow in their griping and bestial tasks. - Malcolm
      Lowry<br />

      THE ROOM
    </p>

    <h4 id="room">
      The first door would open onto a <br />
      bedroom,its floor covered with a <br />
      light-coloured fitted carpet. An <br />
      English double bed would fill the <br />
      whole rear part of it. On the right <br />
      to both sides of the window,there <br />
      would be tall and narrow sets of <br />
      shelves holding a few books, to be <br />
      read and read again, photograph <br />
      albums, packs of cards, pots,necklaces, <br />
      paste jewellery. To the left, an old <br />
      oak wardrobe and two clothes horses <br />
      of wood and brass would stand opposite <br />
      a small wing-chair upholstered in <br />
      thin-striped grey silk and a dressing<br />
      table.<br />

      THEY WOULD?
    </p>

    <ul>
      THEY WOULD
      <li>They would light their first cigarette.</li>
      <li>They would go out.</li>
      <li>
        Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its<br />
        greatest charm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led<br />
        harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so<br />
        perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these<br />
        bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for<br />
        their sole use.
      </li>
      <li>
        But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go
        off<br />
        on a chance adventure.
      </li>
      <li>No plan seemed impossible to them.</li>
      <li>They would open the mail, they would open the newspapers.</li>
      <li>They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy.</li>
      <li>For their means and their desires would always match in all ways.</li>
      <li>
        They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with<br />
        their wisdom.
      </li>
    </ul>
