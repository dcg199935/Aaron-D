      <li>They would light their first cigarette.</li>
      <li>They would go out.</li>
      <li>
        Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its<br />
        greatest charm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led<br />
        harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so<br />
        perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these<br />
        bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for<br />
        their sole use.
      </li>
      <li>
        But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go
        off<br />
        on a chance adventure.
      </li>
      <li>No plan seemed impossible to them.</li>
