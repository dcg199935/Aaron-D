      Translated from the French by David Bellos <br />
      To Denis Buffard Incalculable are the benefits civilization has brought
      us, incommensurable the productive power of all classes of riches
      originated by the inventions and discoveries of science. Inconceivable the
      marvellous creations of the human sex in order to make men more happy,
      more free, and more perfect. Without parallel the crystalline and fecund
      fountainsof the new life which still remains closed to the thirsty lips of
      the people who follow in their griping and bestial tasks. - Malcolm Lowry
