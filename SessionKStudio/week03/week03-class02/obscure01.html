        Your eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the
        narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards,
        in light-coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints,
        depicting, respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer
        named Ville-de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a
        leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which would
        slide back at the merest touch.
        <br />
        The first door would open onto a bedroom,its floor covered with a
        light-coloured fitted carpet. An English double bed would fill the whole
        rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there would
        be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read and
        read again, photograph albums, packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paste
        jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of
        wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in
        thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table.
