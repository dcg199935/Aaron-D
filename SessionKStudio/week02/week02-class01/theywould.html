	<h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std">They would open the mail, they would open the newspapers.</span></h1>
    	   <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> They would light their first cigarette. </span></h1>
    	   <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> They would go out.</span> </h1>
    	   <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning.</span> </h1>
    	   <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> They would meet for lunch, a sandwich or a steak, according to their mood; they would have coffee at a street caf√© and then go home, on foot, slowly.</span></h1>

           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. </h1>
           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> They would hardly bother themselves with it: they would live in it. </span></h1>
           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, a datum, a state of their nature. </span></p>
           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> Their attention would be elsewhere: on the book they would open, on the text they would draft, on the record they would listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day.</span> </h1>
           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> They would work for a long while. </span></h1>
           <h1> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> Then they would dine, or go out for dinner; they would see old friends; they would walk together.</span></h1>

           <h3> <span style="font-family: Birch Std"> Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adventure. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. For their means and their desires would always match in all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living, together.</span></h3>
