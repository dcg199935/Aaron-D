    <h3 id="letter"> <em>T</em>o Denis Buffard Incalculable are the benefits civilization 
        has brought us, incommensurable the productive power of all classes of 
        riches originated by the inventions and discoveries of science. 
        Inconceivable the marvellous creations of the human sex in order to 
        make men more happy, more free, and more perfect. Without parallel the 
        crystalline and fecund fountainsof the new life which still remains 
        closed to the thirsty lips of the people who follow in their griping 
        and bestial tasks. -  Malcolm Lowry </h3>

	<h5> I </h5>

	<br>

	<p> <em>Y</em>our eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the </p>
	narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards,</p>

    <p> in light-coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, 
    <p> depicting, respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer </p>
    <p> named Ville-de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a </p>
    <p> leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which would </p>
    <p> slide back at the merest touch.</p>

    <br>

    <p> There, the carpet would give way to an almost yellow woodblock floor,</p> 
    <p> partly covered by three faded rugs. It would be a living room about </p>


	<p> twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide. On the left, in a kind of recess,</p>

    <p> there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn black leather, with pale </p>

    <p> cherrywood bookcases on either side, heaped with books in untidy piles. </p>

    <p> Above the sofa, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that section</p>

    <p> of the wall.</p>

    	<br>

    <p>On the other side of a small low table, and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to </p>
    <p>the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there </p>
    <p>would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, with a light-brown velvet covering; </p>
    <p>it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and </p>
    <p>providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: agates and stone eggs, snuffboxes,</p> 
    <p>candy-boxes, jade ashtrays, a mother-of-pearl oystershell, a silver fob watch, a cut-glass </p>
    <p>glass, a crystal pyramid, a miniature in an oval frame. </p> 

    <br>


    <h1> ~ </h1>

    <p>During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses.</p>
    <p>It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated -</p> 
    <p>the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and the</p> 
    <p>vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam</p> 
    <p>- the polished wood, the rich, heavy silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a </p>
    <p>haven of peace, a land of happiness.</p>

    <br>

    <p> The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. An </p>
    <p> English double bed would fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there </p>
    <p> would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read and read again, photograph albums, </p>
    <p> packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paste jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of </p> 
    <p> wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table. </p>

    <br>

    <p> Through a half-open door giving on to a bathroom you would glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid brass, a</p>
    <p>large adjustable mirror, a pair of cut-throat razors and their green leather sheaths, bottles, horn-handled brushes, </p>
    <p>sponges. The bedroom walls would be papered with chintz; the bedspread would be a tartan blanket. </p>

    	   <br>
    	   <br>
    	   <br>


    	   <p>There, life would be easy, simple. </p>

           All the servitudes, all the problems brought by material existence would find a natural solution. A cleaning lady would come every morning. Every fortnight, wine, oil and sugar would be delivered. There would be a huge, bright kitchen with blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems, three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques in metallic paint, cupboards everywhere, a handsome whitewood table in the middle with stools and bench-seats. It would be pleasant to come and sit there, every morning, after a shower, scarcely dressed. On the table there would be a sizeable stoneware butter dish, jars of marmalade, honey, toast, grapefruit cut in two. It would be early. It would be May, the start of a long summer's day.</p>

           <h1> <em> <a href="theywould.html"> THEY WOULD... </a></em></h1>


    
    	   <p>  <em>meet for lunch, a sandwich or a steak, according to their mood</em></p>
           <p> <em>they would have coffee at a street café and then go home, on foot, slowly.</em></p>

           <p>Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. </p>

           <p><em>hardly bother themselves with it: they would live in it. </em></p>

           <br>
           
           <p><em>The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, a datum, a state of their nature. </em></p>
           
           <p><em>Their attention would be elsewhere: on the book they would open, on the text they would draft, on the record they would listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day.</em> </p>
           <br>
           
           <p><em>Then they would dine, or go out for dinner; they would see old friends; they would walk together.</em></p>

           <p>Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adventure. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. For their means and their desires would always match in all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living, together.</p>
