        “To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never
        see themselves, by having knowledge of them that they can never have; it
        turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. Just as a
        camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a
        subliminal murder—a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time.”
        - Susan Sontag, On Photography, 1977 "The feet pics, darling. It's been
        15 days. You don't want to make me angry." Everyone in New York has a
        story about a close-call with a celebrity. In a city that's home to one
        million millionaires and almost 80 billionaires, a run-in with the rich
        and famous is bound to happen eventually. I don't frequent the right
        ticketed sex parties and don't have the foresight to book tables 10
        months in advance, so this is a rare occasion for me. But one time, I
        showed up to an indie zine fair allegedly 10 minutes after Jeff Bezos,
        his body-double, and a bodyguard detail, left.

        Your guide to “rule of law,” “land defenders,” and the 1997 Supreme

        A version of this article originally appeared on VICE Canada. There is a
        special kind of sinking feeling that kicks in when news develops faster
        than the human brain can process. In Canada we’ve had to get used to
        this feeling the past few weeks as a long-simmering dispute over a
        natural gas pipeline in northern B.C. has grown into the biggest story
        in the country, with coast-to-coast blockades underlining a broken
        relationship between Indigenous peoples and the provincial and federal
        leaders who claim to care about their rights. Things really started to
        break down when militarized police descended on Wet’suwet’en people and
        their supporters to make way for the $6.6 billion Coastal GasLink
        pipeline earlier this month. The resulting cascade of cross-country
        protest—which has stopped hundreds of trains and disrupted government
        proceedings—has been dubbed the Wet’suwet’en crisis, but it could just
        as easily be called the Canada crisis. After all, it’s not the first
        time the country has pinned the RCMP against Indigenous people defending
        their land (see: Oka crisis, Gustafsen Lake). At the heart of the issue
        is a First Nation’s traditional governance structure, and its ability to
        exist and make decisions outside the constraints of Canada’s colonial
        legal system. We’ve since seen spinoff controversies about alternative
        routes, what to call Indigenous people who occupy their territory in the
        face of police-enforced removal, how much money and jobs these blockades
        will ultimately cost, and what politicians really mean when they invoke
        the “rule of law.” If you’re tuning in late, or need some talking points
        ahead of some tough conversations with relatives and coworkers, VICE is
        here to help with some answers to questions about the Wet’suwet’en
        Nation, Coastal GasLink, and the crisis Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
        says he wants to resolve quickly and peacefully. Why did the RCMP raid
        Indigenous land? In the early hours of February 6, a small army of
        police descended on a snowy outdoor camp where members of the
        Wet’suwet’en Nation and their supporters were keeping watch over
        ancestral land. The raid lasted five days, and resulted in 30 arrests.
        All the war toys came out: low-flying helicopters, dog teams, snipers,
        and drones. It wasn’t the first time that police had conducted a
        military-style raid on Wet’suwet’en territory. In January 2019, the RCMP
        arrested 14 people at another Wet’suwet’en camp with a similarly
        over-the-top show of force. Tactical officers were authorized to use
        lethal force, according to an explosive report uncovered by the
        Guardian. The “why” question boils down to a pipeline company’s request
        to a judge.

        What now? Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs stand by their eviction of
        Coastal GasLink and RCMP, and are still calling for the police to leave
        their territory. If this demand is met, the chiefs say they will call
        off the blockades. Trudeau’s government responded Thursday by announcing
        the RCMP is willing to withdraw its mobile unit on the logging road
        close to Wet’suwet’en camps, and continue operations from the nearby
        town of Houston, B.C. on the condition that Coastal GasLink workers are
        allowed through. The hereditary chiefs and their supporters say cops
        continue to patrol and surveil the area in spite of their eviction, and
        are now calling on a meeting with Trudeau to broker a resolution.
        Canadian Pacific has joined that call for a nation-to-nation meeting
        after members of the Secwepemc Nation near Chase, B.C. started
        blockading the company’s western corridor. With new rail blockades going
        up at the same time as other lines reopen, it’s not clear where this is
        all headed—or if it’s heading anywhere anytime soon. Follow Sarah Berman
